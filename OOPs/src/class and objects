In java, classes and objects are basic concepts of OOPs that are used to represent real world concepts
and entities.

A class in Java is a set of objects which share common characteristics/behavior
and common properties/attributes. it is a user defined blueprint
or prototype from which objects are created

Properties of Java class :
>> class is not a real world entity. It is a template or blueprint
or prototype from which objects are created.
>> class does not occupy memory
>> class is a group of variables of different data types and a group of methods
>> A class can contain :
>>>> Data member
>>>> method
>>>> constructor
>>>> nested class
>>>> interface


class declaration in Java :

access_modifier class <class_name>
{
    data member;
    method;
    constructor;
    nested class;
    interface;
}

Java objcts :

An object in Java is a basic unit of OOP and represents real life entities
Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attribues and methods of a class

An object consists of :
>> State : attributes of an object. Also reflects the properties of an object
>> behavior : methods of an object. Also reflects the response of an object with other objects
>> identity  unique name to an object

when we create an object which is a non-primitive data type, it is always allocated on the heap memory


When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated
all the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class

There are a few ways to create an object :
 >> using new keyword
 Test t = new Test();

 >> using Class.forName(String className) method
 >> using clone() method
 >> deserialization
