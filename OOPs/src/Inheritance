Inheritance is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed
to inherit the features of another class.

Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones.
A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and
feilds of that class.

Inheritance is used  :
>> Code Reusability
>> Method Overriding
>> Abstraction

Terminologies used in Java Inheritance
>> Class
>> Parent class / Base class : The class whose features are inherited.
>> Child class/ derived class : the class that inherits the other class

The extends keyword is used for inheritance in Java.
Using the extends keyword indicates you are derived from an existing class
extends refers to increased functionality

class derived_class extends base_class
{
    // Methods and fields
}

In practice, inheritance and polymorphism are used together in Java
to acheive fast performance and readability of code

Types of Inheritance :
>> Single Inheritance
>> Multilevel Inheritance
>> Hierarchial Inheritance
>> Multiple Inheritance
>> Hybrid Inheritance

>> Single Inheritance
In Single Inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass

>> Multiple Inheritance
In multiple inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class,
and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes
In java, a class cannot directly access the grandparents members

>> Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass(Base class)
for more than one subclass
