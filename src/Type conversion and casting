Implicit conversion and explicit conversion

implicit conversion are like
byte num1 = 127;
int num2 = 256;
num2 = num1;
but we can't do num1 = num2...cause maximum value that byte can store is 127..

explicit conversion is that we are explicitly telling the compiler to convert the datatype...it is also called as casting
for the above example we can do like
num1 = (byte)num2;
