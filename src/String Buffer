StringBuffer is a class in Java that represents a mutable sequence of characters. It provides an alternative to the immutable String class,
 allowing you to modify the contents of a string without creating a new object every time.

 StringBuffer characters are mutable
 he initial capacity of a StringBuffer can be specified when it is created,
 or it can be set later with the ensureCapacity() method.

 The append() method is used to add characters, strings, or other objects to the end of the buffer.
 The insert() method is used to insert characters, strings, or other objects at a specified position in the buffer.
 The delete() method is used to remove characters from the buffer.
 The reverse() method is used to reverse the order of the characters in the buffer.

 StringBuffer(): It reserves room for 16 characters without reallocation
