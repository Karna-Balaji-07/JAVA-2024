 allowing you to modify the contents of a string without creating a new object every time.

 he initial capacity of a String_Buffer can be specified when it is created,
 or it can be set later with the ensureCapacity() method.

 The insert() method is used to insert characters, strings, or other objects at a specified position in the buffer.
 The delete() method is used to remove characters from the buffer.
 The reverse() method is used to reverse the order of the characters in the buffer.
