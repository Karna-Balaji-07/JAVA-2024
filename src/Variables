Variables_and_Datatypes are some thing in which you can store data
variables are virtual storage spaces where you can store some data temporarily

Java is a strongly typed language.
we need to mention the datatype before writing the name of the variable


There are two types of datatypes : primitive and non primitive

Primitive datatypes :
1. integers - short, long, int , long
2. floating - double, float
3. boolean
4. characters

Integers :
int - 4 bytes
long - 8 bytes
short - 2 bytes
byte - 1 byte

Floating :
float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes
double is the default value in java and has high precision

to assign a data of float, we have to explicitly mention as 12.34f, 432.543f....write f after the numbers

char - 2 bytes

boolean :
true or false   not 0 and 1
