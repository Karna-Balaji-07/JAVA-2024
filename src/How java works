In our machine there is something called  JVM.
Since Java is platform independent, it is because of JVM. It can run on any device that has JVM
if you have JVM, you can run java appllications
JVM only understands bytecode.
Java compiler (javac) converts java code into bytecode

java file extension - hello.java
byte code file extension - hello.class


JVM executes the first file that has something called main method.
it should contain public static void main(String args[])

JRE - java runtime environment
JVM is a part of JRE
JRE contains libraries and JVM

java is WORA - write once run anywhere
