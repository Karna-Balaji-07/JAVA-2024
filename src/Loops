Loops

you can execute or print statements mutiple times by using
loops. You dont have to write the statement multiple times
to print the statements

Loops :
1. while loop
2. do while loop
3. for loop


while loop :

int i=0;  initialization of i
while (i<10)   setting condtition for i. while loop will execute only when the condition is true
statements
increment or decrement i


do while loop :
we can use this loop if we want to execute or print the statement atleast once

int i=5;  initialize i
do{
statement
increment or decrement
}while(condition)

for loops :
for(initialize ; condition ; increment/decrement)
statement

we can use for loop when we have a range


If we know how many iterations to go - use for loop
