arrays is a collection of data of one variable
one variables with multiple values

int i =1;
int j = 2;
int k = 3;
int l = 4;

when we create a variable it occupies some storage space

int num[] = {1,2,3,4,5};

to make arrays dynamically
int num1[] = new int[4];

by default all the values of the array will be 0


int nums[][] = new int[3][4];
there are 3 small arrays that are having 4 elements in it

nums[3][4] = nums[i][j]------i = rows ; j = columns

to get the first element in multidimensional arrays :
nums[0][0]
oth row and oth row

nums[2][3]
2nd row and 3 column or 3rd element of 2nd small array

jagged arrray - is when the we are individually mentioning the size od columns
